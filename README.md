## IMTC 505 Project â€“ Group TBN

Welcome to "A Walk Through Time" - an immersive experience project developed by Group TBN for the IMTC 505 course. In this README file, you will find comprehensive information about the project, including the working application, source code, and other essential details.

## 1. Working Application and Source Code

### 1.1 Acquisition of Models:

Our app is designed to be visually engaging, and we achieved this by incorporating various 3D models. This section provides details on where and how we got these models, aiming to be transparent about our sources and methods. In developing "A Walk Through Time," we carefully selected and modified several 3D models to enhance the app's aesthetic and feel, making it more enjoyable for users.


1. **Coverflow:**
   - Model Source: [Simple Scroll-Snap](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/simple-scroll-snap-140884) from Unity Asset Store.
   - Description: We used the "Simple Scroll-Snap" from Unity Asset Store and customized it to create a dynamic Coverflow. This Coverflow is used to display historical images in a seamless and immersive manner, enhancing the overall user experience.

2. **3D Animated GiftBox:**
   - Model Source: [3D Game Kit](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/tutorials/unity-learn-3d-game-kit-115747#content) from Unity Asset Store.
   - Description: We integrated the 3D animated GiftBox from the "3D Game Kit" to introduce gamification elements into our project. The GiftBox model from the kit adds an engaging and interactive component, making the project more immersive for users.

3. **3D Animated Arrow:**
   - Model Source: [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/directional-arrow-1-9658f746810f4390bbcbc88275c40047).
   - Description: To guide users through different locations and provide information, we incorporated a 3D Animated Arrow model from Sketchfab. This arrow serves as a visual indicator, directing users along the path they should follow for an enriched walkthrough experience.

  4. **MRTK3 Components:**
   - Components Used: Different canvas components and Interactble button from [MRTK3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/mrtk3-overview/).
   - Description: We utilized various canvas components and interactive buttons from MRTK3 to enhance user interactions within the application. These components contribute to the overall accessibility and usability of "A Walk Through Time."


### 1.2 Implementations of Interactions (3 points)

#### 1.2.1 User Interactions (a)

In "A Walk Through Time," user interaction is designed to facilitate a historical journey through different time periods. The documentation provides a step-by-step guide on navigating the application, ensuring users can seamlessly engage with its features. Here are three key user interactions within the application:
![Map of the courtyard with 5 points.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dolt8nnzc/image/upload/v1702870917/Picture1_p9ijyi.png)

In our app, users embark on a historical journey through different time periods. We've highlighted five main points: 1) UBCO History, 2) City of Kelowna History, 3) Kelowna Wildfire History, 4) Indigenous People's History, and 5) Okanagan Lake History. 

1. **Interacting with the Coverflow for Historical Information:**
   - In the Coverflow, we've incorporated five images representing different time periods related to historical milestones for each of the five points in our application. For instance, in UBCO History, five images span from the campus's 2004 planning to the 2020 future plans for the downtown campus. Users can swipe left or right to explore these images, and pressing the "Explore" button next to each image provides additional detailed information about that specific time point.

2. **Accessing Gift Boxes with Questions:**
   - After exploring any of the five historical points, users encounter visual cues guiding them to different gift boxes. A two-finger press on the gift box triggers a 3D animation, revealing a question box. Users answer questions based on the gathered information, with multiple attempts allowed. Correct answers earn users points, adding a gamified and interactive element to the application.

3. **Visual Cues for User Guidance:**
   - To enhance user navigation and accessibility, visual cues such as 3D animated arrows are strategically placed throughout the courtyard. These cues guide users to the five different points in our project, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience while exploring the historical locations.


#### 1.2.2 Code Descriptions (b)

In the development of "A Walk Through Time," we've implemented five essential scripts to orchestrate various functionalities within the application:

1. **TouchControl Script:**
   - Purpose: The TouchControl script controls the interactions associated with the gift box and its animations. It provides the necessary functionality to enhance user engagement when interacting with the 3D animated GiftBox, adding a tactile and responsive feel to the user experience.This script facilitates the interactive opening of a giftbox in a Unity project. It responds to a two-finger touch, triggering an animation and displaying a question menu associated with the giftbox.

#### Code Overview

```csharp
private void Update()
{
    // Check for two simultaneous touches
    if (Input.touchCount == 2)
    {
        Touch touch1 = Input.GetTouch(0);
        Touch touch2 = Input.GetTouch(1);
        
        // Cast rays from the touches to detect objects
        Ray ray1 = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(touch1.position);
        Ray ray2 = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(touch2.position);
        
        RaycastHit hit1, hit2;
        // Check if both touches hit objects with the specified tag
        bool isTouchingGiftbox1 = Physics.Raycast(ray1, out hit1) && hit1.transform.CompareTag(checkTag);
        bool isTouchingGiftbox2 = Physics.Raycast(ray2, out hit2) && hit2.transform.CompareTag(checkTag);

        // If both touches hit giftboxes, trigger the two-finger touch event
        if (isTouchingGiftbox1 && isTouchingGiftbox2)
        {
            OnTwoFingerTouch();
        }
    }
}

private void OnTwoFingerTouch()
{
    // Toggle the visibility of the question menu
    tv.ToggleImageVisibility(QuestionMenu);
    
    // Trigger the "Open" animation
    _anim.SetTrigger("Open");
    
    // Enable the interaction trigger
    interactionTrigger.enabled = true;
    
    // Trigger the "Pickup" animation
    _anim.SetTrigger("Pickup");
}
```

2. **Simple Scroll-Snap Script:**
   - Purpose: The Simple Scroll-Snap script takes charge of controlling the Coverflow feature. It enables users to seamlessly navigate through historical images by swiping, interact with buttons, and view additional information through the canvas associated with each image.
![SimpleScrollSnap](https://res.cloudinary.com/dolt8nnzc/image/upload/v1702872797/scroll_egbvbj.png)

**SimpleScrollSnap** script provides a straightforward scroll-snapping functionality for Unity UI elements. It includes features such as automatic layout, infinite scrolling, and transition effects. The script, authored by Daniel Lochner, ensures proper movement and layout customization, supporting horizontal and vertical scrolling. It is compatible with Unity's UI system and requires a ScrollRect component. The code structure consists of field declarations, methods for initialization and runtime updates, and configurable properties for movement, layout, and snapping behavior.

3. **GiftBoxController Script:**
   - Purpose: This script is responsible for managing the GiftBox, controlling its animations, and handling the user interface related to questions. It ensures the smooth interaction and engagement of users with the gamified elements in the application.
   - The **GiftBoxController Script** manages the interaction and activation of a sequence of gift boxes in a Unity project. The `HandleClick` method is called when a gift box is clicked. It increments the click count, deactivates the current gift box after a short delay, and activates the next gift box in the sequence. The sequence is defined by a switch statement that determines which gift box to activate based on the click count. The script uses coroutines to introduce delays between the deactivation and activation of gift boxes, creating a sequential opening effect. Once all gift boxes are opened, a log message is displayed.
```csharp
public void HandleClick()
{
    clickCount++;
    
    Invoke("DeactivateCurrentGiftBox", 2f);
    switch (clickCount)
    {
        case 1:
            StartCoroutine(ActivateGiftBox(giftbox2, 3f));
            break;
        case 2:
            StartCoroutine(ActivateGiftBox(giftbox3, 4f));
            break;
        default:
            Debug.Log("All gift boxes opened!");
            break;
    }
}

private void DeactivateCurrentGiftBox()
{
    
    if (clickCount == 1)
    {
        giftbox1.SetActive(false);
    }
    else if (clickCount == 2)
    {
        giftbox2.SetActive(false);
    }
}

private IEnumerator ActivateGiftBox(GameObject giftbox, float delay)
{
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(delay);
    giftbox.SetActive(true);
}
```

4. **ToggleVisibility Script:**
   - Purpose: The ToggleVisibility script plays a crucial role in managing the visibility of different GameObjects within the Unity scene. This script ensures that specific elements are displayed or hidden based on the application's context, contributing to a clean and organized user interface.

5. **QuestBoxController Script:**
   - Purpose: The QuestBoxController script takes control of the quiz-related canvas, including questions, correct answer displays, and wrong answer displays. It manages the quiz interaction, allowing users to answer questions and providing feedback based on their responses, thereby enhancing the educational aspect of the application.
   - The QuestBoxController Script is responsible for managing the quiz-related canvas within the application, handling aspects such as questions, correct answer displays, and wrong answer displays. Its primary purpose is to control the interaction flow of the quiz, allowing users to answer questions and providing feedback based on their responses to enhance the educational aspect of the application.

The `whenExitClicked` function in the script is triggered when the exit button associated with the quiz box is clicked. This function increments the `numberOfExitClick` variable, which tracks the number of times the exit button has been clicked. Based on the value of `numberOfExitClick`, the function performs different actions to transition between different quiz box prefabs. Each case represents a stage of the transition, where one quiz box is deactivated, and the next one is activated. This sequential activation of different quiz box prefabs creates a progression through the quiz content.
```csharp
public void whenExitClicked()
{
    numberOfExitClick++;
    switch (numberOfExitClick)
    {
        case 1:
            questBoxPrefab.SetActive(false);
            questBoxPrefab2.SetActive(true);
            break;
        case 2:
            questBoxPrefab2.SetActive(false);
            questBoxPrefab3.SetActive(true);
            break;
        case 3:
            questBoxPrefab3.SetActive(false);
            questBoxPrefab4.SetActive(true);
            break;
        default:
            break;
    }
}
```


These scripts collectively form the backbone of our application, enabling a seamless and engaging user experience while ensuring the smooth functioning of various interactive elements.
